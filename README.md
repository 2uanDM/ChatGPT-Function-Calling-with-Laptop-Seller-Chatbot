# Chat'Innov Hackathon - Laptop Seller Chatbot

This repository contains the code for the [Chat'Innov Hackathon](https://hust.edu.vn/vi/news/tin-tuc-su-kien/sinh-vien-dai-hoc-bach-khoa-ha-noi-thang-ap-dao-cuoc-thi-chat-innov-2023-654946.html) with the goal of creating a chatbot that can help a "poor" student to buy a best laptop with a limited budget. In this hackathon, we won the 1st prize and the gift is an Dell üíª Inspiron 15 laptop üòä

This chatbot is created using:

- [Streamlit](https://www.streamlit.io/) framework for GUI

- [GPT-3.5-Turbo-16k](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3-5) model for the chatbot.

The interesting thing here is that the chatbot is guided using a SQLite database containing ~ 240 laptops crawled from [Th·∫ø Gi·ªõi Di ƒê·ªông](https://www.thegioididong.com/) and using the new feature of ChatGPT API - [Function Calling](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling) to using some predefined functions.
